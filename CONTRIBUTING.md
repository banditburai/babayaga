### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Provide a detailed description of the proposed enhancement**
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful**
- **List any alternative solutions you've considered**

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. Ensure the test suite passes (`npm run test:servers`)
4. Make sure your code follows the existing style
5. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/banditburai/babayaga.git
   cd babayaga
   npm install
   ```

2. **Create a branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes and test:**
   ```bash
   npm run test:servers
   npm run test:e2e
   npx tsc --noEmit  # Type check
   ```

4. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new CDP tool for network inspection"
   ```

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow conventional commits:

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation only changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc)
- `refactor:` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test:` - Adding missing tests
- `chore:` - Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

## Adding New Tools

When adding new MCP tools:

1. **Update the appropriate server** (`src/cdp-mcp-server/` or Puppeteer integration)
2. **Add TypeScript types** for your tool parameters
3. **Update documentation:**
   - Add to README.md tools table
   - Create examples in docs/
4. **Add tests** in the test suite
5. **Update CHANGELOG.md**

### Example: Adding a new CDP tool

```typescript
// In src/cdp-mcp-server/index.ts

// 1. Add to tools array
{
  name: 'cdp_get_cookies',
  description: 'Get all cookies from the current page',
  inputSchema: {
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
      domain: {
        type: 'string',
        description: 'Optional domain filter',
      },
    },
  },
},

// 2. Add handler in switch statement
case 'cdp_get_cookies':
  return await this.getCookies(toolArgs?.domain as string);

// 3. Implement the method
private async getCookies(domain?: string) {
  if (!this.activeClient) {
    throw new Error('Not connected to Chrome DevTools');
  }
  
  const { cookies } = await this.activeClient.send('Network.getCookies', {
    urls: domain ? [`https://${domain}`] : undefined,
  });
  
  return {
    content: [{
      type: 'text',
      text: JSON.stringify(cookies, null, 2),
    }],
  };
}
```
