# 🍯 Babayaga Honeypot

**Mission**: "Ensure trustworthy agent-driven testing through verification, evidence collection, and anti-deception measures"

## Overview

Babayaga Honeypot is the **trust layer** of the Babayaga testing ecosystem. While other Babayaga servers test applications, Honeypot tests the testing agents themselves - ensuring they actually perform the work they claim to do rather than faking results.

## 🎯 Core Capabilities

- ✅ **Checklist-driven test execution** - Forces agents to complete tests sequentially
- ✅ **Evidence collection and verification** - Captures screenshots, logs, timing data
- ✅ **Agent behavior monitoring** - Detects suspicious patterns and impossible results
- ✅ **Deception detection and prevention** - Identifies agents attempting to fake test results
- ✅ **Cross-agent test validation** - Multi-agent verification of critical tests
- ✅ **Audit trail generation** - Comprehensive reports with verifiable evidence

## 🔧 Key Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `honeypot_initialize_checklist` | Start agent testing session with checklist |
| `honeypot_get_next_test` | Get next test item for agent to execute |
| `honeypot_log_action` | Log agent actions during test execution |
| `honeypot_record_tool_call` | Record tool usage with timing and evidence |
| `honeypot_complete_test` | Mark test complete with results and verification |
| `honeypot_verify_evidence` | Validate test evidence for authenticity |
| `honeypot_detect_deception` | Analyze agent behavior for suspicious patterns |
| `honeypot_generate_report` | Create comprehensive audit reports |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
cd babayaga-honeypot
npm install
```

### Start the Server

```bash
npm start
```

### Configure with Claude

```bash
claude mcp add babayaga-honeypot "npm start --workspace=babayaga-honeypot"
```

## 📋 Usage Example

### 1. Initialize Agent Testing

```typescript
// Start a new testing session
await honeypot_initialize_checklist({
  agentId: "claude-tester-001",
  checklistPath: "tests/checklists/babayaga-basic-tests.json"
});
```

### 2. Execute Tests Sequentially

```typescript
// Get next test
const test = await honeypot_get_next_test({
  agentId: "claude-tester-001"
});

// Log actions
await honeypot_log_action({
  agentId: "claude-tester-001",
  itemId: "test-001",
  action: "Starting CDP health check"
});

// Use actual tools (from other Babayaga servers)
const result = await qa_measure_element({ selector: "#element" });

// Record the tool call with evidence
await honeypot_record_tool_call({
  agentId: "claude-tester-001",
  itemId: "test-001",
  toolName: "qa_measure_element",
  parameters: { selector: "#element" },
  response: result,
  duration: 45,
  success: true
});

// Complete the test
await honeypot_complete_test({
  agentId: "claude-tester-001",
  itemId: "test-001",
  passed: true,
  comments: "Element measurement successful. Verified dimensions match expected values."
});
```

### 3. Generate Reports

```typescript
// Get comprehensive test report
const report = await honeypot_generate_report({
  agentId: "claude-tester-001"
});
```

## 🕵️ Anti-Deception Features

### Evidence Verification
- **Screenshot authenticity** - Validates images aren't AI-generated
- **Timing validation** - Ensures operations take realistic time
- **Cross-reference checks** - Validates consistency across evidence
- **Impossible task detection** - Traps that catch cheating agents

### Behavioral Analysis
- **Statistical anomaly detection** - Identifies unlikely patterns
- **Resource usage validation** - Ensures operations consume expected resources
- **Cross-agent correlation** - Detects coordinated deceptive behavior
- **Pattern recognition** - Learns signatures of authentic vs fake behavior

### Honeypot Traps
- **Non-existent elements** - Requests to measure elements that don't exist
- **Timing constraints** - Operations requiring minimum execution times
- **Consistency checks** - Verifying measurements reflect actual DOM state
- **Resource fingerprinting** - Analyzing system resource consumption patterns

## 🎪 Integration with Babayaga Ecosystem

### Cross-Server Validation

Babayaga Honeypot validates agent behavior across all Babayaga servers:

```typescript
// Validate QA testing agents
const qaValidation = await honeypot_verify_evidence({
  serverType: "babayaga-qe",
  agentId: "qa-agent-001",
  evidence: qaTestResults
});

// Validate Performance testing agents  
const perfValidation = await honeypot_verify_evidence({
  serverType: "babayaga-performance", 
  agentId: "perf-agent-001",
  evidence: performanceResults
});
```

### Shared Trust Infrastructure

```typescript
interface BabayagaTrustMetrics {
  agentId: string;
  trustScore: number;          // 0-100 based on historical behavior
  verificationLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  evidenceQuality: number;     // Quality of collected evidence
  deceptionAlerts: number;     // Number of suspicious behaviors detected
  crossValidated: boolean;     // Verified by multiple agents
}
```

## 📊 Metrics and Reporting

### Trust Scores
- **Agent Reliability**: Historical success rate and evidence quality
- **Deception Detection**: Number of caught attempts to fake results
- **Evidence Quality**: Completeness and authenticity of collected evidence
- **Cross-Validation Success**: Multi-agent agreement on test results

### Audit Reports
- **Execution Timeline**: Complete chronological test execution
- **Evidence Chain**: Cryptographic verification of all evidence
